			<hr>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p> Currently in the industry of linguistic analysis dictionaries must be manually converted into a digital
				format and placed into a spreadsheet before the advantages of technologies such as formulae and quality
				of life feature can be utilised to aid researchers in their analysis. This act is a tedious and
				time-consuming activity which not only requires a strong eye for detail and an advanced level of
				computer dexterity it most importantly ruins the researches workflow and detracts from meaningful hours
				that could be spent making progress and dissecting the content being prepared. To serve as a fix for
				this issue an automatic OCR tool will be developed to aid in the extraction of dictionary entries for Dr
				Rachel Hendery and her team to use in their works.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Technologies</h2>
			<p>
				The developed solution will have a web based infrastructure which most importantly allows for package
				integration from a wide variety of sources, in turn increasesing the potential of the application and
				adding to the quality of life and functionality. The primary packages used include PDF.js to help
				extract the text from a file to then process, following once split and cleaned up it will be passed to
				Datatables which allows for user interaction and data manipulation, and finally Electron is used to
				transform the application into a localised program one can access anywhere straight from the desktop.
